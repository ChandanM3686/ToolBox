            <h3> Midjourney</h3>
            <p>Midjourney is an AI image generator primarily known for creating photorealistic AI art based on text prompts. It excels at generating highly detailed images, especially in various artistic styles. Users access it through Discord and can request images by providing specific commands and descriptions.

                Midjourney is moving from Discord to its own website, but only select users who have created over 10,000 images with the AI image generator tool have been invited to test the site out.</p>

                What’s crazy is how you can give it a video, image, or even a piece of text and watch it craft videos. While it’s not without its quirks, the sheer potential and innovation are groundbreaking.
